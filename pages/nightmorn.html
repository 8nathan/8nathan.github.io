            <p><b>Nightmorn</b> is a 1-4 player online coop horror game created as part of my final year
            project at Falmouth University, along with 9 other students.
            The project was completed over the course of the academic year, and was showcased at
            the <b>Falmouth Games Expo 2025</b>, during which we won the <b>'Best of Third Year'</b>
            award by popular vote.
            Our studio born from this project, <a href="https://keeled-moon.com/" target="_blank">Keeled Moon</a>, has plans
            to take <b>Nightmorn</b> further and one day release it as a completed project!
            </p>

            <p>I worked as a <b>systems programmer</b>, <b>technical artist</b> and <b>animator</b>
            on the project, prototyping and implementing the <b>vision cone</b> system within the game
            using Unity's scriptable render pipeline, as well as the <b>animation backend</b> used to
            to manage animations and inverse kinematics for player characters based on their held equipment.
            </p>

            <p>
            As the game supports <b>online multiplayer</b> it was also a great opportunity to learn more about
            networking, and due to it's complexity we got a lot of practice prioritizing issues and fixing bugs
            before our expo release. Another challenge we overcame was organizing and coordinating a team
            of 10 developers. It definitely put our <b>teamworking</b> and <b>project management</b> skills to the test!
